= Instructions:

== Migrate the Sakila database to a cloud provider of your choice using the MySql and the cloud provider CLI  (research in progress)

== Write the SQL queries to answer the following questions:

* Select the first name, last name, and email address of all the customers who have rented a movie.

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
SELECT
    concat((first_name), ' ', (last_name)) rental_customers,
    email
FROM
    rental r
    INNER JOIN customer USING (customer_id)
GROUP BY
    2
ORDER BY
    1;
```

* What is the average payment made by each customer (display the customer id, customer name (concatenated), and the average payment made).

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
SELECT
    c.customer_id,
    concat((c.first_name), ' ', (c.last_name)) rental_customers,
    c.email,
    format(avg(p.amount), 2, 'de_DE') average_payment_made
FROM
    payment p
    INNER JOIN customer c USING (customer_id)
GROUP BY
    1
ORDER BY
    2;
```

* Select the name and email address of all the customers who have rented the "Action" movies.

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
SELECT
    DISTINCT concat(c.first_name, ' ', c.last_name) customer_name,
    c.email,
    cat.name type_movies_rented
FROM
    rental r

    cat.name = 'Action'

** Write the query using sub queries with multiple WHERE clause and IN condition

    (
        SELECT
            'Action'

* Use the case statement to create a new column classifying existing columns as either or high value transactions based on the amount of payment. If the amount is between 0 and 2, label should be low and if the amount is between 2 and 4, the label should be medium, and if it is more than 4, then it should be high.

`*_Answer:_*`

```sql
SELECT
    *,
    CASE
        WHEN amount <= 2 THEN "low"
        WHEN amount <= 4 THEN "medium"
        WHEN amount > 4 THEN "high"
    END AS classified_as
FROM
    payment;
